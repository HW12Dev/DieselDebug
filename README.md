# DieselDebug
Mod for Diesel games that pauses the game after
the dxdiag check (crashes the game when a debugger is attached),
allowing you to attach a debugger.

**Only works as intended for RAID: World War II. PAYDAY: The Heist and PAYDAY 2 support is intended, but not finished!**

## Instructions
1. Place the `VERSION.dll` and `DieselDebug_[Game].dll` in the same folder as the game's executable
2. Launch the game
3. When the game appears frozen, or you see a message box appear telling you to attach a debugger, attach a debugger
4. Debug the game/your mod
